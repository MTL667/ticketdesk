# Gebouwbeheer Ticket Portal

A production-ready Next.js 15.4 application for managing internal building maintenance tickets, integrated with ClickUp and authenticated via Microsoft Entra ID (Azure AD).

## Features

- **Azure AD Multi-Tenant Authentication**: Secure authentication with Microsoft Entra ID, supporting multiple tenants with tenant validation
- **ClickUp Integration**: All ticket data is stored and managed through ClickUp API (no database required)
- **ClickUp Form Integration**: Users create tickets via ClickUp forms - fully customizable in ClickUp
- **Ticket Viewing**: Users can view their own tickets with status, attachments, and full details
- **Bilingual Support**: Dutch/French interface
- **Docker Support**: Ready for containerized deployment

## Tech Stack

- Next.js 15.4 (App Router)
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS
- NextAuth.js v5 (Azure AD provider)
- ClickUp API

## Prerequisites

- Node.js 20+
- ClickUp account with API token
- Azure AD application registered in Microsoft Entra ID
- Docker (for containerized deployment)

## Setup

### 1. Clone and Install

```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Environment Variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and fill in all required values:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

Required environment variables:

- `CLICKUP_API_TOKEN`: Your ClickUp API token
- `CLICKUP_LIST_ID`: The ClickUp List ID where tickets will be created
- `AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID`: Azure AD application client ID
- `AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET`: Azure AD application client secret
- `AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID`: Set to `"common"` or `"organizations"` for multi-tenant
- `ALLOWED_TENANTS`: Comma-separated list of allowed tenant IDs (GUIDs)
- `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: Random secret for NextAuth (generate with `openssl rand -base64 32`)
- `NEXTAUTH_URL`: Your application URL (e.g., `http://localhost:3000` for development)
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL`: Public base URL of the application
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLICKUP_FORM_URL`: URL to your ClickUp form for creating tickets (optional, creates link on homepage)

### 3. Azure AD Configuration

1. Register an application in Azure AD (Microsoft Entra ID)
2. Configure redirect URI: `{NEXTAUTH_URL}/api/auth/callback/azure-ad`
3. Enable multi-tenant support if needed
4. Add required API permissions (Microsoft Graph - User.Read)
5. Set `ALLOWED_TENANTS` to restrict access to specific tenant IDs

### 4. ClickUp Configuration

1. Create a List in ClickUp where tickets will be stored
2. Get the List ID from the ClickUp URL (format: `/v/li/{LIST_ID}`)
3. Generate an API token in ClickUp Settings > Apps > API
4. Add the token and List ID to your `.env` file
5. Create a ClickUp Form for your List (ClickUp Settings > Forms)
6. Copy the form URL and add it to `NEXT_PUBLIC_CLICKUP_FORM_URL` in your environment

### 5. Run Development Server

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) in your browser.

## Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
npm start
```

## Docker Deployment

### Build Docker Image

```bash
docker build -t ticketdesk .
```

### Run Container

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 \
  -e CLICKUP_API_TOKEN=your_token \
  -e CLICKUP_LIST_ID=your_list_id \
  -e AZURE_AD_CLIENT_ID=your_client_id \
  -e AZURE_AD_CLIENT_SECRET=your_client_secret \
  -e AZURE_AD_TENANT_ID=common \
  -e ALLOWED_TENANTS=tenant-id-1,tenant-id-2 \
  -e NEXTAUTH_SECRET=your_secret \
  -e NEXTAUTH_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
  -e NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000 \
  ticketdesk
```

Or use a `.env` file:

```bash
docker run -p 3000:3000 --env-file .env ticketdesk
```

## Usage

1. **Sign In**: Users from allowed Azure AD tenants can sign in with their Microsoft account
2. **Create Ticket**: Click "Nieuw Ticket Aanmaken" to open the ClickUp form in a new tab
3. **View Tickets**: Access "Mijn Tickets" to see all tickets associated with your email
4. **Ticket Details**: Click on any ticket to view full details, status, and attachments

## Ticket Filtering Configuration

⚠️ **Email filtering is ACTIVE** - users only see tickets associated with their email address.

### Requirements:

Your ClickUp form **MUST** include an email field for tickets to be visible:

1. In your ClickUp List, create a custom field named "Email" or "Requester Email" (type: Email or Text)
2. Add this field to your ClickUp Form and mark it as **Required**
3. Users must fill in their login email address when submitting tickets

### How It Works:

The app filters tickets by searching for the user's email in:
1. **Custom fields** named "email", "e-mail", or containing "email" (case insensitive)
2. **Description** text (fallback)

### Important Notes:

- ✅ Users only see tickets with their email address
- ❌ Tickets without an email are not visible to any user
- 🔒 This provides privacy - users cannot see each other's tickets
- 📧 The app shows the user's email on the form page as a reminder

**See `CLICKUP_FORM_SETUP.md` for detailed setup instructions.**

## Security

- All routes (except auth) are protected by middleware
- Only users from allowed tenants can sign in
- All ClickUp API calls happen server-side
- Session management via NextAuth with secure cookies
- Input validation on both client and server

## License

Private/internal use only.
